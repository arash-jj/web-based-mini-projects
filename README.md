## 💡 How to Use

### For Learning

1. **Pick a project** that matches your skill level
2. **Read the code** to understand the implementation
3. **Modify & experiment** - Change colors, logic, features
4. **Build variations** - Create your own version
5. **Share your progress** - Submit PRs with improvements

### For Portfolio

- **Showcase projects** on your GitHub profile
- **Deploy projects** using GitHub Pages or Vercel
- **Add features** and improvements to stand out
- **Document your work** with detailed README files

### Best Practices

```javascript
// ✅ DO - Write clean, readable code
function calculateSum(numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}

// ❌ DON'T - Write unclear code
function calc(n) {
  let s = 0;
  for(let i=0; i<n. length; i++) s+=n[i];
  return s;
}
```
